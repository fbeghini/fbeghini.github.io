 abstract = {Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome
and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the
replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We
performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and
two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional
cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike
microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the
gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than
controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species
typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the
microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the
putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with
CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were
associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC
trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in
datasets not considered for model training and independent
validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled
analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline
trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001),
identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism
and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus
identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate
disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical
prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.},

 abstract = {AbstractCultivation-free metagenomic analysis afforded
unprecedented details on the diversity, structure and potential
functions of microbial communities in different environments. When
employed to study the viral fraction of the community that is
recalcitrant to cultivation, metagenomics can shed light into the
diversity of viruses and their role in natural ecosystems.
However, despite the increasing interest in virome metagenomics,
methodological issues still hinder the proper interpretation and
comparison of results across studies. Virome enrichment
experimental protocols are key multi-step processes needed for
separating and concentrating the viral fraction from the whole
microbial community prior to sequencing. However, there is little
information on their efficiency and their potential biases. To
fill this gap, we used metagenomic and amplicon sequencing to
examine the microbial community composition through the serial
filtration and concentration steps commonly used to produce
viral-enriched metagenomes. The analyses were performed on water
and sediment samples from an Alpine lake. We found that, although
the diversity of the retained microbial communities declined
progressively during the serial filtration, the final viral
fraction contained a large proportion (from 10% to 40%) of
non-viral taxa, and that the efficacy of filtration showed biases
based on taxonomy. Our results quantified the amount of bacterial
genetic material in viromes and highlighted the influence of
sample type on the enrichment efficacy. Moreover, since
viral-enriched samples contained a significant portion of
microbial taxa, computational sequence analysis should account for
such biases in the downstream interpretation
pipeline.ImportanceFiltration is a commonly used method to enrich
viral particles in environmental samples. However, there is little
information on its efficiency and potential biases on the final
result. Using a sequence-based analysis on water and sediment
samples, we found that filtration efficacy is dependent on sample
type and that the final virome contained a large proportion of
non-viral taxa. Our finding stressed the importance of downstream
analysis to avoid biased interpretation of data.},

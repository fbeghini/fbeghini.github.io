abstract: Culture-independent analyses of microbial communities have progressed dramatically
  in the last decade, particularly due to advances in methods for biological profiling
  via shotgun metagenomics. Opportunities for improvement continue to accelerate,
  with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level
  diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved
  methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes
  newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available.
  Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic
  profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These
  methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes)
  and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of
  an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic
  and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously
  described by only 15 isolate genomes. With open-source implementations and cloud-deployable
  reproducible workflows, the bioBakery 3 platform can help researchers deepen the
  resolution, scale, and accuracy of multi-omic profiling for microbial community
  studies.

abstract: When humans assemble into face-to-face social networks, they create an extended
  social environment that permits exposure to the microbiome of others, thereby shaping
  the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels1–6.
  Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and detailed microbiome sequencing
  data in 1,787 adults within 18 isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the
  relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using both
  species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between
  many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections.
  Furthermore, strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections, suggesting
  the relevance of a person’s broader network. We also observe that socially central
  people are more microbially similar to the overall village than socially peripheral
  people. Among 301 people whose microbiome was re-measured 2 years later, we observe
  greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus otherwise similar unconnected
  co-villagers. Clusters of species and strains occur within clusters of people in
  village social networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches
  within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.

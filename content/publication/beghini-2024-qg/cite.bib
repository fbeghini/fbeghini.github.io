 abstract = {When humans assemble into face-to-face social networks, they
create an extended social environment that permits exposure to
the microbiome of others, thereby shaping the composition and
diversity of the microbiome at individual and population
levels1–6. Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and
detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,787 adults within 18
isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the relationship
between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using
both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial
sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including
non-familial and non-household connections. Furthermore,
strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections,
suggesting the relevance of a person’s broader network. We also
observe that socially central people are more microbially similar
to the overall village than socially peripheral people. Among 301
people whose microbiome was re-measured 2 years later, we observe
greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus
otherwise similar unconnected co-villagers. Clusters of species
and strains occur within clusters of people in village social
networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches
within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are
manifested.},

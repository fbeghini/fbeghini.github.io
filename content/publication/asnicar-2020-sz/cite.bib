 abstract = {Microbial genomes are available at an ever-increasing pace, as
cultivation and sequencing become cheaper and obtaining
metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) becomes more effective.
Phylogenetic placement methods to contextualize hundreds of
thousands of genomes must thus be efficiently scalable and
sensitive from closely related strains to divergent phyla. We
present PhyloPhlAn 3.0, an accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use method
for large-scale microbial genome characterization and phylogenetic
analysis at multiple levels of resolution. PhyloPhlAn 3.0 can
assign genomes from isolate sequencing or MAGs to species-level
genome bins built from >230,000 publically available sequences.
For individual clades of interest, it reconstructs strain-level
phylogenies from among the closest species using clade-specific
maximally informative markers. At the other extreme of resolution,
it scales to large phylogenies comprising >17,000 microbial
species. Examples including Staphylococcus aureus isolates, gut
metagenomes, and meta-analyses demonstrate the ability of
PhyloPhlAn 3.0 to support genomic and metagenomic analyses.},

abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Humans have coevolved with microbial communities to establish
  a mutually advantageous relationship that is still poorly characterized and can
  provide a better understanding of the human microbiome. Comparative metagenomic
  analysis of human and non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach
  to study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been characterized in NHP
  microbiomes due to their poor representation in the available cataloged microbial
  diversity, thus limiting the potential of such comparative approaches. RESULTS:
  We reconstruct over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species from 6 available
  NHP metagenomic cohorts, resulting in an increase of the mappable fraction of metagenomic
  reads by 600%. These novel species highlight that almost 90% of the microbial diversity
  associated with NHPs has been overlooked. Comparative analysis of this new catalog
  of taxa with the collection of over 150,000 genomes from human metagenomes points
  at a limited species-level overlap, with only 20% of microbial candidate species
  in NHPs also found in the human microbiome. This overlap occurs mainly between NHPs
  and non-Westernized human populations and NHPs living in captivity, suggesting that
  host lifestyle plays a role comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate
  intestinal microbiome. Several NHP-specific species are phylogenetically related
  to human-associated microbes, such as Elusimicrobia and Treponema, and could be
  the consequence of host-dependent evolutionary trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The newly
  reconstructed species greatly expand the microbial diversity associated with NHPs,
  thus enabling better interrogation of the primate microbiome and empowering in-depth
  human and non-human comparative and co-diversification studies.'

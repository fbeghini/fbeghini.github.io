abstract: The gut microbiome is shaped by diet and influences host metabolism; however,
  these links are complex and can be unique to each individual. We performed deep
  metagenomic sequencing of 1,203 gut microbiomes from 1,098 individuals enrolled
  in the Personalised Responses to Dietary Composition Trial (PREDICT 1) study, whose
  detailed long-term diet information, as well as hundreds of fasting and same-meal
  postprandial cardiometabolic blood marker measurements were available. We found
  many significant associations between microbes and specific nutrients, foods, food
  groups and general dietary indices, which were driven especially by the presence
  and diversity of healthy and plant-based foods. Microbial biomarkers of obesity
  were reproducible across external publicly available cohorts and in agreement with
  circulating blood metabolites that are indicators of cardiovascular disease risk.
  While some microbes, such as Prevotella copri and Blastocystis spp., were indicators
  of favorable postprandial glucose metabolism, overall microbiome composition was
  predictive for a large panel of cardiometabolic blood markers including fasting
  and postprandial glycemic, lipemic and inflammatory indices. The panel of intestinal
  species associated with healthy dietary habits overlapped with those associated
  with favorable cardiometabolic and postprandial markers, indicating that our large-scale
  resource can potentially stratify the gut microbiome into generalizable health levels
  in individuals without clinically manifest disease.

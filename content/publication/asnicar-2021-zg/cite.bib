 abstract = {The gut microbiome is shaped by diet and influences host
metabolism; however, these links are complex and can be unique to
each individual. We performed deep metagenomic sequencing of
1,203 gut microbiomes from 1,098 individuals enrolled in the
Personalised Responses to Dietary Composition Trial (PREDICT 1)
study, whose detailed long-term diet information, as well as
hundreds of fasting and same-meal postprandial cardiometabolic
blood marker measurements were available. We found many
significant associations between microbes and specific nutrients,
foods, food groups and general dietary indices, which were driven
especially by the presence and diversity of healthy and
plant-based foods. Microbial biomarkers of obesity were
reproducible across external publicly available cohorts and in
agreement with circulating blood metabolites that are indicators
of cardiovascular disease risk. While some microbes, such as
Prevotella copri and Blastocystis spp., were indicators of
favorable postprandial glucose metabolism, overall microbiome
composition was predictive for a large panel of cardiometabolic
blood markers including fasting and postprandial glycemic,
lipemic and inflammatory indices. The panel of intestinal species
associated with healthy dietary habits overlapped with those
associated with favorable cardiometabolic and postprandial
markers, indicating that our large-scale resource can potentially
stratify the gut microbiome into generalizable health levels in
individuals without clinically manifest disease.},

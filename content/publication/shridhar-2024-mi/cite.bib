 abstract = {Despite a growing interest in the gut microbiome of
non-industrialized countries, data linking deeply sequenced
microbiomes from such settings to diverse host phenotypes and
situational factors remain uncommon. Using metagenomic data from
a community-based cohort of 1,871 people from 19 isolated
villages in the Mesoamerican highlands of western Honduras, we
report associations between bacterial species and human
phenotypes and factors. Among them, socioeconomic factors account
for 51.44% of the total associations. Meta-analysis of
species-level profiles across several datasets identified several
species associated with body mass index, consistent with previous
findings. Furthermore, the inclusion of strain-phylogenetic
information modifies the overall relationship between the gut
microbiome and the phenotypes, especially for some factors like
household wealth (e.g., wealthier individuals harbor different
strains of Eubacterium rectale). Our analysis suggests a role
that gut microbiome surveillance can play in understanding broad
features of individual and public health.},

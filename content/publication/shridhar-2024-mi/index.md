abstract: Despite a growing interest in the gut microbiome of non-industrialized countries,
  data linking deeply sequenced microbiomes from such settings to diverse host phenotypes
  and situational factors remain uncommon. Using metagenomic data from a community-based
  cohort of 1,871 people from 19 isolated villages in the Mesoamerican highlands of
  western Honduras, we report associations between bacterial species and human phenotypes
  and factors. Among them, socioeconomic factors account for 51.44% of the total associations.
  Meta-analysis of species-level profiles across several datasets identified several
  species associated with body mass index, consistent with previous findings. Furthermore,
  the inclusion of strain-phylogenetic information modifies the overall relationship
  between the gut microbiome and the phenotypes, especially for some factors like
  household wealth (e.g., wealthier individuals harbor different strains of Eubacterium
  rectale). Our analysis suggests a role that gut microbiome surveillance can play
  in understanding broad features of individual and public health.

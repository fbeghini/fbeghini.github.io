abstract: To date, little is known about the start-up of photobioreactors and the
  progressive development of stable microalgal-bacterial consortia with a view to
  the full-scale treatment of real wastewater. Two photo-sequencing bioreactors, one
  inoculated with Chlorella vulgaris (RC) and one with the absence of inoculum (RW),
  were fed with real municipal wastewater and run in parallel for 101 days. The influence
  of the inoculation was evaluated in terms of pollutant removal efficiency, excess
  sludge production, solids settleability and microbial community characteristics.
  No significant differences were observed in the removal of COD (89 ± 4%; 88 ± 3%)
  and ammonium (99 ± 1%; 99 ± 1%), mainly associated with bacteria activity. During
  the first weeks of acclimation, Chlorella vulgaris in RC promoted better P removal
  and very high variations of DO and pH. Conversely, under steady-state conditions,
  no significant differences were observed between the performances of RC and RW,
  showing good settleability and low effluent solids, 7 ± 8 and 13 ± 10 mg TSS/L respectively.
  Microbiome analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that, despite a different
  evolution, the microbial community was quite similar in both reactors under steady
  state conditions. Overall, the results suggested that the inoculation of microalgae
  is not essential to engender a photobioreactor aimed at treating real municipal
  wastewater.

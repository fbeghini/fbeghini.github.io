 abstract = {PURPOSE: Variations in the oral microbiome are potentially
implicated in social inequalities in oral disease, cancers, and
metabolic disease. We describe sociodemographic variation of oral
microbiomes in a diverse sample. METHODS: We performed 16S rRNA
sequencing on mouthwash specimens in a subsample (n = 282) of the
2013-2014 population-based New York City Health and Nutrition
Examination Study. We examined differential abundance of 216
operational taxonomic units, and alpha and beta diversity by age,
sex, income, education, nativity, and race/ethnicity. For
comparison, we examined differential abundance by diet, smoking
status, and oral health behaviors. RESULTS: Sixty-nine
operational taxonomic units were differentially abundant by any
sociodemographic variable (false discovery rate < 0.01),
including 27 by race/ethnicity, 21 by family income, 19 by
education, 3 by sex. We found 49 differentially abundant by
smoking status, 23 by diet, 12 by oral health behaviors. Genera
differing for multiple sociodemographic characteristics included
Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified oral microbiome variation consistent
with health inequalities, more taxa differing by race/ethnicity
than diet, and more by SES variables than oral health behaviors.
Investigation is warranted into possible mediating effects of the
oral microbiome in social disparities in oral and metabolic
diseases and cancers.},

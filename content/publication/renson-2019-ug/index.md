abstract: 'PURPOSE: Variations in the oral microbiome are potentially implicated in
  social inequalities in oral disease, cancers, and metabolic disease. We describe
  sociodemographic variation of oral microbiomes in a diverse sample. METHODS: We
  performed 16S rRNA sequencing on mouthwash specimens in a subsample (n = 282) of
  the 2013-2014 population-based New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Study.
  We examined differential abundance of 216 operational taxonomic units, and alpha
  and beta diversity by age, sex, income, education, nativity, and race/ethnicity.
  For comparison, we examined differential abundance by diet, smoking status, and
  oral health behaviors. RESULTS: Sixty-nine operational taxonomic units were differentially
  abundant by any sociodemographic variable (false discovery rate < 0.01), including
  27 by race/ethnicity, 21 by family income, 19 by education, 3 by sex. We found 49
  differentially abundant by smoking status, 23 by diet, 12 by oral health behaviors.
  Genera differing for multiple sociodemographic characteristics included Lactobacillus,
  Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium. CONCLUSIONS: We identified oral microbiome
  variation consistent with health inequalities, more taxa differing by race/ethnicity
  than diet, and more by SES variables than oral health behaviors. Investigation is
  warranted into possible mediating effects of the oral microbiome in social disparities
  in oral and metabolic diseases and cancers.'

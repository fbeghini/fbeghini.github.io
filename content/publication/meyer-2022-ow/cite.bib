 abstract = {Evaluating metagenomic software is key for optimizing metagenome
interpretation and focus of the Initiative for the Critical
Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI). The CAMI II
challenge engaged the community to assess methods on realistic
and complex datasets with long- and short-read sequences, created
computationally from around 1,700 new and known genomes, as well
as 600 new plasmids and viruses. Here we analyze 5,002 results by
76 program versions. Substantial improvements were seen in
assembly, some due to long-read data. Related strains still were
challenging for assembly and genome recovery through binning, as
was assembly quality for the latter. Profilers markedly matured,
with taxon profilers and binners excelling at higher bacterial
ranks, but underperforming for viruses and Archaea. Clinical
pathogen detection results revealed a need to improve
reproducibility. Runtime and …},

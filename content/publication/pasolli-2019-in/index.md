abstract: The body-wide human microbiome plays a role in health, but its full diversity
  remains uncharacterized, particularly outside of the gut and in international populations.
  We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of
  high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated
  4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories
  (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples),
  expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40%
  of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions
  including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs
  permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic
  reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the
  mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species,
  expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation
  of metagenomic technologies.

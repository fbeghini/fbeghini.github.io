 abstract = {The body-wide human microbiome plays a role in health, but its
full diversity remains uncharacterized, particularly outside of
the gut and in international populations. We leveraged 9,428
metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high
quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We
recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without
genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are
prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand
underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized
populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in
SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development
(94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper
microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of
metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median
94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify
thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species,
expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow
better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.},

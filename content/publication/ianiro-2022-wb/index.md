abstract: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective against recurrent
  Clostridioides difficile infection and is considered a promising treatment for other
  microbiome-related disorders, but a comprehensive understanding of microbial engraftment
  dynamics is lacking, which prevents informed applications of this therapeutic approach.
  Here, we performed an integrated shotgun metagenomic systematic meta-analysis of
  new and publicly available stool microbiomes collected from 226 triads of donors,
  pre-FMT recipients and post-FMT recipients across eight different disease types.
  By leveraging improved metagenomic strain-profiling to infer strain sharing, we
  found that recipients with higher donor strain engraftment were more likely to experience
  clinical success after FMT (P = 0.017) when evaluated across studies. Considering
  all cohorts, increased engraftment was noted in individuals receiving FMT from multiple
  routes (for example, both via capsules and colonoscopy during the same treatment)
  as well as in antibiotic-treated recipients with infectious diseases compared with
  antibiotic-naïve patients with noncommunicable diseases. Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria
  species (including Bifidobacteria) displayed higher engraftment than Firmicutes
  except for six under-characterized Firmicutes species. Cross-dataset machine learning
  predicted the presence or absence of species in the post-FMT recipient at 0.77 average
  AUROC in leave-one-dataset-out evaluation, and highlighted the relevance of microbial
  abundance, prevalence and taxonomy to infer post-FMT species presence. By exploring
  the dynamics of microbiome engraftment after FMT and their association with clinical
  variables, our study uncovered species-specific engraftment patterns and presented
  machine learning models able to predict donors that might optimize post-FMT specific
  microbiome characteristics for disease-targeted FMT protocols.

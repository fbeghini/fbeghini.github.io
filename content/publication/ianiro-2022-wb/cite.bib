 abstract = {Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective against
recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection and is considered a
promising treatment for other microbiome-related disorders, but a
comprehensive understanding of microbial engraftment dynamics is
lacking, which prevents informed applications of this therapeutic
approach. Here, we performed an integrated shotgun metagenomic
systematic meta-analysis of new and publicly available stool
microbiomes collected from 226 triads of donors, pre-FMT
recipients and post-FMT recipients across eight different disease
types. By leveraging improved metagenomic strain-profiling to
infer strain sharing, we found that recipients with higher donor
strain engraftment were more likely to experience clinical success
after FMT (P = 0.017) when evaluated across studies. Considering
all cohorts, increased engraftment was noted in individuals
receiving FMT from multiple routes (for example, both via capsules
and colonoscopy during the same treatment) as well as in
antibiotic-treated recipients with infectious diseases compared
with antibiotic-naïve patients with noncommunicable diseases.
Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria species (including
Bifidobacteria) displayed higher engraftment than Firmicutes
except for six under-characterized Firmicutes species.
Cross-dataset machine learning predicted the presence or absence
of species in the post-FMT recipient at 0.77 average AUROC in
leave-one-dataset-out evaluation, and highlighted the relevance of
microbial abundance, prevalence and taxonomy to infer post-FMT
species presence. By exploring the dynamics of microbiome
engraftment after FMT and their association with clinical
variables, our study uncovered species-specific engraftment
patterns and presented machine learning models able to predict
donors that might optimize post-FMT specific microbiome
characteristics for disease-targeted FMT protocols.},

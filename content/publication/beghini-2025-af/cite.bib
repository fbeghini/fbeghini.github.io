 abstract = {AbstractThe gut microbiome is integral to human health, yet
research data to date has emphasized industrialized populations.
Here, we performed large-scale shotgun metagenomic sequencing on
1,889 individuals from rural Honduras, providing the most
comprehensive microbiome dataset from Central America. We identify
a distinct microbial composition enriched inPrevotellaspecies,
with 861 previously unreported bacterial species. Functional
profiling reveals unique carbohydrate metabolism adaptations
consistent with high-fiber diets. Longitudinal analysis over two
years reveals microbiome instability, with shifts in taxonomic
diversity and metabolic potential, including changes associated
with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we characterize the gut
virome and eukaryotic microbiome, identifying novel viral taxa,
includingCrassviralesphages, and a high prevalence
ofBlastocystisspecies in individuals with greater microbial
diversity. Finally, by integrating host genomic data obtained from
low-pass saliva whole-genome sequencing, we uncover significant
host-microbiome associations, highlighting the influence of human
genetic variation on microbial composition. People who are more
genetically similar also have more similar gut microbiomes. These
findings expand our understanding of microbiome diversity in
non-industrialized populations, highlighting the uniqueness of
those microbiomes and underscoring the need for global microbiome
research.},

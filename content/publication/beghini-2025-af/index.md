abstract: AbstractThe gut microbiome is integral to human health, yet research data
  to date has emphasized industrialized populations. Here, we performed large-scale
  shotgun metagenomic sequencing on 1,889 individuals from rural Honduras, providing
  the most comprehensive microbiome dataset from Central America. We identify a distinct
  microbial composition enriched inPrevotellaspecies, with 861 previously unreported
  bacterial species. Functional profiling reveals unique carbohydrate metabolism adaptations
  consistent with high-fiber diets. Longitudinal analysis over two years reveals microbiome
  instability, with shifts in taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential, including
  changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we characterize the
  gut virome and eukaryotic microbiome, identifying novel viral taxa, includingCrassviralesphages,
  and a high prevalence ofBlastocystisspecies in individuals with greater microbial
  diversity. Finally, by integrating host genomic data obtained from low-pass saliva
  whole-genome sequencing, we uncover significant host-microbiome associations, highlighting
  the influence of human genetic variation on microbial composition. People who are
  more genetically similar also have more similar gut microbiomes. These findings
  expand our understanding of microbiome diversity in non-industrialized populations,
  highlighting the uniqueness of those microbiomes and underscoring the need for global
  microbiome research.

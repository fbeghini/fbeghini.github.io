 abstract = {The particularly interdisciplinary nature of human microbiome
research makes the organization and reporting of results spanning
epidemiology, biology, bioinformatics, translational medicine and
statistics a challenge. Commonly used reporting guidelines for
observational or genetic epidemiology studies lack key features
specific to microbiome studies. Therefore, a multidisciplinary
group of microbiome epidemiology researchers adapted guidelines
for observational and genetic studies to culture-independent
human microbiome studies, and also developed new reporting
elements for laboratory, bioinformatics and statistical analyses
tailored to microbiome studies. The resulting tool, called
‘Strengthening The Organization and Reporting of Microbiome
Studies’ (STORMS), is composed of a 17-item checklist organized
into six sections that correspond to the typical sections of a
scientific publication, presented as an …},

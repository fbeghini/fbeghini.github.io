 abstract = {The influence of unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms on human
gut health and disease is still largely unexplored. Blastocystis
spp. commonly colonize the gut, but its clinical significance and
ecological role are currently unsettled. We have developed a
high-sensitivity bioinformatic pipeline to detect Blastocystis
subtypes (STs) from shotgun metagenomics, and applied it to 12
large data sets, comprising 1689 subjects of different geographic
origin, disease status and lifestyle. We confirmed and extended
previous observations on the high prevalence the microrganism in
the population (14.9%), its non-random and ST-specific
distribution, and its ability to cause persistent (asymptomatic)
colonization. These findings, along with the higher prevalence
observed in non-westernized individuals, the lack of positive
association with any of the disease considered, and decreased
presence in individuals with dysbiosis associated with colorectal
cancer and Crohn's disease, strongly suggest that Blastocystis is
a component of the healthy gut microbiome. Further, we found an
inverse association between body mass index and Blastocystis, and
strong co-occurrence with archaeal organisms (Methanobrevibacter
smithii) and several bacterial species. The association of
specific microbial community structures with Blastocystis was
confirmed by the high predictability (up to 0.91 area under the
curve) of the microorganism colonization based on the
species-level composition of the microbiome. Finally, we
reconstructed and functionally profiled 43 new draft Blastocystis
genomes and discovered a higher intra subtype variability of ST1
and ST2 compared with ST3 and ST4. Altogether, we provide an
in-depth epidemiologic, ecological, and genomic analysis of
Blastocystis, and show how metagenomics can be crucial to advance
population genomics of human parasites.The ISME Journal advance

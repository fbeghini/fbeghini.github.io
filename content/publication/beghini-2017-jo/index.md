abstract: The influence of unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms on human gut health
  and disease is still largely unexplored. Blastocystis spp. commonly colonize the
  gut, but its clinical significance and ecological role are currently unsettled.
  We have developed a high-sensitivity bioinformatic pipeline to detect Blastocystis
  subtypes (STs) from shotgun metagenomics, and applied it to 12 large data sets,
  comprising 1689 subjects of different geographic origin, disease status and lifestyle.
  We confirmed and extended previous observations on the high prevalence the microrganism
  in the population (14.9%), its non-random and ST-specific distribution, and its
  ability to cause persistent (asymptomatic) colonization. These findings, along with
  the higher prevalence observed in non-westernized individuals, the lack of positive
  association with any of the disease considered, and decreased presence in individuals
  with dysbiosis associated with colorectal cancer and Crohn's disease, strongly suggest
  that Blastocystis is a component of the healthy gut microbiome. Further, we found
  an inverse association between body mass index and Blastocystis, and strong co-occurrence
  with archaeal organisms (Methanobrevibacter smithii) and several bacterial species.
  The association of specific microbial community structures with Blastocystis was
  confirmed by the high predictability (up to 0.91 area under the curve) of the microorganism
  colonization based on the species-level composition of the microbiome. Finally,
  we reconstructed and functionally profiled 43 new draft Blastocystis genomes and
  discovered a higher intra subtype variability of ST1 and ST2 compared with ST3 and
  ST4. Altogether, we provide an in-depth epidemiologic, ecological, and genomic analysis
  of Blastocystis, and show how metagenomics can be crucial to advance population
  genomics of human parasites.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 22 August

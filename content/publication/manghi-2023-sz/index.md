abstract: Mouse models are key tools for investigating host-microbiome interactions.
  However, shotgun metagenomics can only profile a limited fraction of the mouse gut
  microbiome. Here, we employ a metagenomic profiling method, MetaPhlAn 4, which exploits
  a large catalog of metagenome-assembled genomes (including 22,718 metagenome-assembled
  genomes from mice) to improve the profiling of the mouse gut microbiome. We combine
  622 samples from eight public datasets and an additional cohort of 97 mouse microbiomes,
  and we assess the potential of MetaPhlAn 4 to better identify diet-related changes
  in the host microbiome using a meta-analysis approach. We find multiple, strong,
  and reproducible diet-related microbial biomarkers, largely increasing those identifiable
  by other available methods relying only on reference information. The strongest
  drivers of the diet-induced changes are uncharacterized and …

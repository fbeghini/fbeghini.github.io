 abstract = {Mouse models are key tools for investigating host-microbiome
interactions. However, shotgun metagenomics can only profile a
limited fraction of the mouse gut microbiome. Here, we employ a
metagenomic profiling method, MetaPhlAn 4, which exploits a large
catalog of metagenome-assembled genomes (including 22,718
metagenome-assembled genomes from mice) to improve the profiling
of the mouse gut microbiome. We combine 622 samples from eight
public datasets and an additional cohort of 97 mouse microbiomes,
and we assess the potential of MetaPhlAn 4 to better identify
diet-related changes in the host microbiome using a meta-analysis
approach. We find multiple, strong, and reproducible diet-related
microbial biomarkers, largely increasing those identifiable by
other available methods relying only on reference information.
The strongest drivers of the diet-induced changes are
uncharacterized and …},

abstract: The acquisition and development of the infant microbiome are key to establishing
  a healthy host-microbiome symbiosis. The maternal microbial reservoir is thought
  to play a crucial role in this process. However, the source and transmission routes
  of the infant pioneering microbes are poorly understood. To address this, we longitudinally
  sampled the microbiome of 25 mother-infant pairs across multiple body sites from
  birth up to 4 months postpartum. Strain-level metagenomic profiling showed a rapid
  influx of microbes at birth followed by strong selection during the first few days
  of life. Maternal skin and vaginal strains colonize only transiently, and the infant
  continues to acquire microbes from distinct maternal sources after birth. Maternal
  gut strains proved more persistent in the infant gut and ecologically better adapted
  than those acquired from other sources. Together, these data describe the mother-to-infant
  microbiome transmission routes that are integral in the development of the infant
  microbiome.

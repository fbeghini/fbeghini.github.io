abstract: Metagenomic assembly enables new organism discovery from microbial communities,
  but it can only capture few abundant organisms from most metagenomes. Here we present
  MetaPhlAn 4, which integrates information from metagenome assemblies and microbial
  isolate genomes for more comprehensive metagenomic taxonomic profiling. From a curated
  collection of 1.01 M prokaryotic reference and metagenome-assembled genomes, we
  define unique marker genes for 26,970 species-level genome bins, 4,992 of them taxonomically
  unidentified at the species level. MetaPhlAn 4 explains ~20% more reads in most
  international human gut microbiomes and >40% in less-characterized environments
  such as the rumen microbiome and proves more accurate than available alternatives
  on synthetic evaluations while also reliably quantifying organisms with no cultured
  isolates. Application of the method to >24,500 metagenomes highlights previously
  undetected species to be strong biomarkers for host conditions and lifestyles in
  human and mouse microbiomes and shows that even previously uncharacterized species
  can be genetically profiled at the resolution of single microbial strains.

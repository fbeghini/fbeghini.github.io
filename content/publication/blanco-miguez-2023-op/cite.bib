 abstract = {Metagenomic assembly enables new organism discovery from microbial
communities, but it can only capture few abundant organisms from
most metagenomes. Here we present MetaPhlAn 4, which integrates
information from metagenome assemblies and microbial isolate
genomes for more comprehensive metagenomic taxonomic profiling.
From a curated collection of 1.01 M prokaryotic reference and
metagenome-assembled genomes, we define unique marker genes for
26,970 species-level genome bins, 4,992 of them taxonomically
unidentified at the species level. MetaPhlAn 4 explains ~20% more
reads in most international human gut microbiomes and >40% in
less-characterized environments such as the rumen microbiome and
proves more accurate than available alternatives on synthetic
evaluations while also reliably quantifying organisms with no
cultured isolates. Application of the method to >24,500
metagenomes highlights previously undetected species to be strong
biomarkers for host conditions and lifestyles in human and mouse
microbiomes and shows that even previously uncharacterized species
can be genetically profiled at the resolution of single microbial
strains.},

abstract: "PURPOSE: The effect of tobacco exposure on the oral microbiome has not
  been established. METHODS: We performed amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal
  RNA gene V4 variable region to estimate bacterial community characteristics in 259
  oral rinse samples, selected based on self-reported smoking and serum cotinine levels,
  from the 2013-2014 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Study. We identified
  differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by primary and secondhand
  tobacco exposure, and used ``microbe set enrichment analysis'' to assess shifts
  in microbial oxygen utilization. RESULTS: Cigarette smoking was associated with
  depletion of aerobic OTUs (Enrichment Score test statistic ES = -0.75, P = .002)
  with a minority (29%) of aerobic OTUs enriched in current smokers compared with
  never smokers. Consistent shifts in the microbiota were observed for current cigarette
  smokers as for nonsmokers with secondhand exposure as measured by serum cotinine
  levels. Differential abundance findings were similar in crude and adjusted analyses.
  CONCLUSIONS: Results support a plausible link between tobacco exposure and shifts
  in the oral microbiome at the population level through three lines of evidence:
  (1) a shift in microbiota oxygen utilization associated with primary tobacco smoke
  exposure; (2) consistency of abundance fold changes associated with current smoking
  and shifts along the gradient of secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmokers; and
  (3) consistency after adjusting for a priori hypothesized confounders."

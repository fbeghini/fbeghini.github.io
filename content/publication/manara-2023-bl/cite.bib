 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a systemic immune-mediated disease
primarily manifesting as skin redness and inflammation.
Balneotherapy proved to be a successful non-pharmacological
option to reduce the skin areas affected by the disease, but the
specific mechanisms underlying this effect have not been
elucidated yet. Here we test the hypothesis that the effect of
thermal treatments on psoriatic lesions could be partially
mediated by changes in the resident microbial population, i.e.,
the microbiome. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled patients with
psoriasis and monitored changes in their skin and gut microbiome
after a 12-bath balneotherapy course with a combination of 16S
rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomics. Changes in the
resident microbiome were then correlated with thermal therapy
outcomes evaluated as changes in Psoriasis Area and Severity
Index (PASI) and Body Surface Area index (BSA). RESULTS: The
amplicon sequencing analysis of the skin microbiome showed that
after thermal treatment the microbiome composition of affected
areas improved to approach that typical of unaffected skin. We
moreover identified some low-abundance bacterial biomarkers
indicative of disease status and treatment efficacy, and we
showed via metagenomic sequencing that thermal treatments and
thermal water drinking affect the fecal microbiome to host more
species associated with favorable metabolic health. CONCLUSIONS:
Changes in lower-abundance microbial taxa presence and abundance
could be the basis for the positive effect of thermal water
treatment and drinking on the cutaneous and systemic
symptomatology of psoriasis.},

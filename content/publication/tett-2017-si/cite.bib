 abstract = {Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease that
has been associated with cutaneous microbial dysbiosis by
culture-dependent investigations and rRNA community profiling. We
applied, for the first time, high-resolution shotgun metagenomics
to characterise the microbiome of psoriatic and unaffected skin
from 28 individuals. We demonstrate psoriatic ear sites have a
decreased diversity and psoriasis is associated with an increase
in Staphylococcus, but overall the microbiomes of psoriatic and
unaffected sites display few discriminative features at the
species level. Finer strain-level analysis reveals strain
heterogeneity colonisation and functional variability providing
the intriguing hypothesis of psoriatic niche-specific strain
adaptation or selection. Furthermore, we accessed the poorly
characterised, but abundant, clades with limited sequence
information in public databases, including â€¦},

abstract: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease that has been
  associated with cutaneous microbial dysbiosis by culture-dependent investigations
  and rRNA community profiling. We applied, for the first time, high-resolution shotgun
  metagenomics to characterise the microbiome of psoriatic and unaffected skin from
  28 individuals. We demonstrate psoriatic ear sites have a decreased diversity and
  psoriasis is associated with an increase in Staphylococcus, but overall the microbiomes
  of psoriatic and unaffected sites display few discriminative features at the species
  level. Finer strain-level analysis reveals strain heterogeneity colonisation and
  functional variability providing the intriguing hypothesis of psoriatic niche-specific
  strain adaptation or selection. Furthermore, we accessed the poorly characterised,
  but abundant, clades with limited sequence information in public databases, including

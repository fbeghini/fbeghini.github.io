abstract: A large body of data both in animals and humans demonstrates that the gut
  microbiome plays a fundamental role in cancer immunity and in determining the efficacy
  of cancer immunotherapy. In this work, we have investigated whether and to what
  extent the gut microbiome can influence the antitumor activity of neo-epitope-based
  cancer vaccines in a BALB/c-CT26 cancer mouse model. Similarly to that observed
  in the C57BL/6-B16 model, Bifidobacterium administration per se has a beneficial
  effect on CT26 tumor inhibition. Furthermore, the combination of Bifidobacterium
  administration and vaccination resulted in a protection which was superior to vaccination
  alone and to Bifidobacterium administration alone, and correlated with an increase
  in the frequency of vaccine-specific T cells. The gut microbiome analysis by 16S
  rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics showed that tumor challenge rapidly
  altered the microbiome population, with Muribaculaceae being enriched and Lachnospiraceae
  being reduced. Over time, the population of Muribaculaceae progressively reduced
  while the Lachnospiraceae population increased—a trend that appeared to be retarded
  by the oral administration of Bifidobacterium. Interestingly, in some Bacteroidales,
  Prevotella and Muribaculacee species we identified sequences highly homologous to
  immunogenic neo-epitopes of CT26 cells, supporting the possible role of “molecular
  mimicry” in anticancer immunity. Our data strengthen the importance of the microbiome
  in cancer immunity and suggests a microbiome-based strategy to potentiate neo-epitope-based
  cancer vaccines.

 abstract = {A large body of data both in animals and humans demonstrates that
the gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in cancer immunity
and in determining the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this
work, we have investigated whether and to what extent the gut
microbiome can influence the antitumor activity of
neo-epitope-based cancer vaccines in a BALB/c-CT26 cancer mouse
model. Similarly to that observed in the C57BL/6-B16 model,
Bifidobacterium administration per se has a beneficial effect on
CT26 tumor inhibition. Furthermore, the combination of
Bifidobacterium administration and vaccination resulted in a
protection which was superior to vaccination alone and to
Bifidobacterium administration alone, and correlated with an
increase in the frequency of vaccine-specific T cells. The gut
microbiome analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun
metagenomics showed that tumor challenge rapidly altered the
microbiome population, with Muribaculaceae being enriched and
Lachnospiraceae being reduced. Over time, the population of
Muribaculaceae progressively reduced while the Lachnospiraceae
population increased—a trend that appeared to be retarded by the
oral administration of Bifidobacterium. Interestingly, in some
Bacteroidales, Prevotella and Muribaculacee species we identified
sequences highly homologous to immunogenic neo-epitopes of CT26
cells, supporting the possible role of “molecular mimicry” in
anticancer immunity. Our data strengthen the importance of the
microbiome in cancer immunity and suggests a microbiome-based
strategy to potentiate neo-epitope-based cancer vaccines.},
